## This was a LONG day

* Figure out how to load a new minimal jekyll themed site
* Figure out how to launch atom and pycharm easily from git bash
* How to launch them from WSL

Fully decked out my WSL. In the process did a really deep dive into ubuntu. The challenges were endless. I had roughly 100 tabs open at once. There are so many helpful blogposts out there. It is really inspiring and makes me want to contribute for other noobs like me. I spent an enormous amount of time getting my WSL to show colorways and such.
