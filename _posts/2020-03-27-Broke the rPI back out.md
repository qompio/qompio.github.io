# Broke the rPI back out

Just as the title suggests, I broke the rPI back out. I was deeply inspired by all the linux terminal work I've been doing on my laptop. Last year I tried to create a webserver on the rPI and got extremely close, I fell short of being able to set up port forwarding on my parents network. After a few attempts and shutting down the internet one too many times, I gave it a rest and never quite picked it back up. That was my first ever deep(ish) dive into linux.

Fast forward to now. Let me tell you a story. I had been working quite diligently on my [Material Request Form project](https://qompio.github.io/Material_Request_Form/) as an extracurricular for work. (It should be noted, this webpage was specifically written to my mans Sander as a call for discussion). This was really getting me back in the swing of programming. I took the UW foundational python class in the fall, but let it falter in the months of January and February.

 In order to get the MRF program to a point where I could ask pointed questions, I began brushing up on Git. I am still quite weak at git, but am ever improving. I was using Git in the git bash terminal and was having an o.k time. But this made me hungry for Linux. I had tried using a Virtual Machine to boot Ubuntu, but found my computer to be running too slowly, and knew I would never use the VM if that was the Case. Sander mentioned [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). I decided to give this a try. Check it out:

 This took me a really long time. The theme is powerlevel10k with solarized dark dircolors. I have the solarized dark theme for vim as well. I have tried to acquire syntax-highlighting for oh-my-zsh, but every plugin I have downloaded has had an odd bug I haven't sorted out.

 Customizing the shell and terminal appearance is a great beginner crash course in linux. Gets you personally vested, you are forced edit config files, troubleshoot nonsense, and keep digging for *the* solution.

 __ANYWAYS__, this is not for naught.

 This is mostly a huge catch-up on the last few weeks/days. I'll have to make another post about the effect quarantine has had on my computer appreciation.

 So to get back to the theme of the post. __I GOT MY RASPBERRY PI3 BACK OUT!!__

 The customization of linux shell prompted me to want to get my rPi back online and do something with it. I love the ease of ssh in the linux terminal. ssh right into my rPi and I'm off to the races. Tonight I completed the first huge step. I wanted to get a torrentbox going. Ideally this will have a mounted hard drive with samba? plex? sharing capabilities, and of course a kill-switch. But Tonight, I got the rPi to use my nordvpn to torrent a legal torrent through deluged. I was friiiiiickin stoked. (this took so much longer than just "tonight").

 Long story. But clearer tutorials will come from this. This was just serving as somewhat of an update to my non-existent followers. Seriously. I find it so cool I can publish this to the web and no one will read it. :)
