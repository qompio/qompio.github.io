# The Intelligent Investor
##### Written by Benjamin Graham. Commentary by Jason Zweig

#### Chapter 1:
##### Know the difference between investing and speculation
  * An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principle and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.
  * recognize the speculative factor in all holdings, but keep this component in minor limits.


##### Grahams laws:
  * You must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its underlying business, before you buy its stock
  * you must deliberately protect yourself from serious losses
  * you must aspire to 'adequate', not extraordinary, performance


* Invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.

* Imagine two places are 130 miles apart. I can get there in two hours if I drive at 65mph or I could get there in one hour if I drive 130mph. If I drive at 130mph and arrive there faster, was I "right"?

##### On speculation:
  * You must never delude yourself into thinking you're investing when you're speculating
  * speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin to take it seriously
  * You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager
