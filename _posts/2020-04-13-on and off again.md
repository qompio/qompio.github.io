## Let's talk about troubleshooting.

Recently my entire life has been troubleshooting. My work place is riddled with small problems that impede any sense of progress. My bike is really acting up due to a fall and winter of neglect. My interest in computers has led me down insanely deep problem solving rabbit holes.

So today, the personal problem to solve was my samba file share stopped working. why the fuck did it stop working. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling. I have yet to go and set up the .conf files. The plex is down. In the meanwhile, I have 4 flat bicycle tubes in the basement because I fucked up repeatedly in putting new tubes in. I was trying to bring all my speaker stuff to my new apartment, and forgot the power chord. I just seasoned a cast iron and in the last step, went to take it out of the oven to cool It was so hot it melted the tea towel's plastic fibres on the handle. This is all on top of work being such a IT nightmare. With training my boy Adam, and being the only electrical tech left, It's pretty dip shitty out there.

sometimes its just like: what the fuck.

what the fuck.

I guess just turn it off and on again...
