# The Shape of You

## "Unable to percieve the shape of You,

## I find you all around me.

## Your presence fills my eyes with Your Love,

## It humbles my heart,

## For You are everywhere."

	-Hakim Sanai

Found this poem saved as a .txt in a dusty folder on my desktop earlier today when I was doing some long awaited file cleaning. Glad it was there.
